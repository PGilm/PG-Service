Make Dragon Commands allows you to quickly generate Dragon DVC commands 
corresponding to keyboard shortcuts. 

INSTRUCTIONS: 
IN SHORT: 
  1. SET UP a CSV file of COMMAND NAMEs and KEYBOARD SHORTCUTs (using 
SendSystemKeys [key names](https://www.nuance.com/products/help/dragon/dragon-for-pc/scriptref/Content/scrptref/key_names.htm)). 
  2. RUN Make Dragon Commands to create a Dragon XML file. 
  3. IMPORT this XML file into the Dragon Command Browser and, when done, 
  4. Change the properties of the newly imported commands (they will be set to the 
     Make Dragon Commands application) to specify the actual specific application you 
     want (the program should be running to show up in the drop-down list).  When you are 
     all done, 
  5. GO into the application and say "What Can I Say" to see your commands. 
  6. Have fun!
